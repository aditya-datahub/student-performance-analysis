# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis

**A Python-based data analysis project** that explores student performance (math, reading, writing), study habits, gender, and ethnic group distributions using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
This repository analyzes a student dataset to uncover insights around academic performance and demographic/behavioral factors such as study hours, gender, and ethnic group.  
The analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) with charts and explanations.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Analyze score distributions in Math, Reading, and Writing.  
- Compare academic performance across **Gender** and **Ethnic Groups**.  
- Explore how **study hours** impact student outcomes.  
- Create clean, visually appealing, and shareable plots.

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included
- 📊 Count plots for categorical variables (e.g., Gender, EthnicGroup)  
- 🥧 Pie chart showing ethnic group distribution  
- 📦 Boxplots for score ranges and outliers  
- 📉 Bar charts for average scores and comparisons
